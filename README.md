Java Subtraction Practice Program
This repository contains a simple Java program designed to help students practice subtraction. The program generates two single-digit integers and prompts the user to subtract the smaller number from the larger one.

Program Description
The program follows these steps:
1. Generate two single-digit integers, `number1` and `number2`.
2. If `number1` is less than `number2`, the two numbers are swapped.
3. The program then prompts the student with a question in the format: "What is `number1` - `number2`?".
4. The student enters their answer.
5. The program checks the student's answer and displays a message indicating whether the answer is correct.
